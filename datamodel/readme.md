The arrest_model.png file shows the dimensional model that includes the fact and dimensional tables. Both the facts and dimensional tables have keys and descriptive attributes. Using transformation I was able to create facts for the facts_arrest table. 

The arrests.dbs file has the schema to create the model in DBSchema. 
Lastly, the arrests.sql file includes the SQL code to create the different tables in the model.
