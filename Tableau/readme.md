The Arrests_by_Race.png is a bar graph shows the number of arrests for different races. This helps us get a better understanding of the perpetrator, and can be useful information for the police department. 

The Daily_Arrests.png is a line graph that shows different dates and the number of arrests that happened on a specific date. It shows that in early January 2024 there was a high arrest count, this can help the police department understand what time of year has a higher arrest rate and which months have lower rates. 

The Offense_AgeGroup.png graph is a heatmap that shows the different offenses across age groups. The graph states that people from ages 25-44 tend to have a high number of misdemeanors. 

The Percent_ArrestType.png is a pie chart that shows the percentage of arrests by the three different offense types felony, misdemeanor, and violation. The highest percentage is misdemeanors which is 53.45% of the arrests that are made. The lowest is violations which is 2.54% of arrests. 

Lastly, I created a dashboard that has all the graphs in one place.
