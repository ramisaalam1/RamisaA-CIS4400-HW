# Ramisa Alam: NYPD Arrest Data

### Explanation of the data:
The NYPD Arrest Dataset can be found through the NYC Open Data website. The dataset is given by the Police Department (NYPD) and is updated quarterly. It provides detailed data about all the New York City arrests that happened throughout the year. It provides information regarding the type of crime, its location, and when it occurred. This data is essential to collect because it allows us to keep track of crime patterns in NYC and identify opportunities for improvement. It also includes demographic information such as the age and gender of the arrested person and what borough it occurred in. These data points can help individuals understand what regions of New York City experience the most crime.
